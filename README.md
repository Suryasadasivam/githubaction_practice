🚀 Automating My ML Workflow with GitHub Actions!

After containerizing my ML model with Docker and managing it via Docker Compose, I took the next big step:
✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions 🔄

Now, every time I push code to my repository:
🔧 The build runs automatically
✅ Code is tested
🐳 Docker images are rebuilt
📦 Artifacts are versioned and ready for deployment

This automation removes manual steps and ensures my model pipeline is always up-to-date, reliable, and deployable — whether it’s for testing, staging, or production.

🔁 The best part? One .yml file, and your ML pipeline becomes continuous.

Next up: integrating cloud deployment triggers and notifications. Stay tuned! 🎯
